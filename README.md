# Tour Mallorca Mock Web Page

(OLD TEXT) A simple web site design that I built to gain more experience with working with Bootstrap and test out things I had recently learned (at the time). The project is my idea of what a basic site for a travel agency focused on the island of Mallorca in Spain would be like. The project only includes designs for the landing page and about page. All images of Mallorca were taken by me during my time spent living in Spain.

Built using: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, EJS, Node.js (Express), and MongoDB (Mongoose)

## Prerequisites
Nothing extra needs to be done/installed from the user, just simply enter the above URL in your browser. Note that the webpage may or may not take a while to boot up. A restriction of Heroku's sandbox/free tier for app deployment is that long periods of inactivity lead to the server being put into hibernation- hence requiring some time for boot-up before the page is served to you.
