# Tour Mallorca Mock Web Page

Tour Mallorca is a mock travel agency that is supposed to be located in the island of Mallorca. This is a full-stack project that incorporates both front-end and back-end code, as well as database integration, built with an MVC organizational structure in mind. The project is still in development, so not all features may be complete and can be altered (or removed) in later updates. It is deployed (and viewable) on Heroku.

Built using: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, EJS, Node.js (with Express), and MongoDB

URL: https://tour-mallorca.herokuapp.com/

## Prerequisites
Nothing extra needs to be done/installed from the user, just simply enter the above URL in your browser. Note that the webpage may or may not take a while to boot up. A restriction of Heroku's sandbox/free tier for app deployment is that long periods of inactivity lead to the server being put into hibernation- hence requiring some time for boot-up before the page is served to you.
