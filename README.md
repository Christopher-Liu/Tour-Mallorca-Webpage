# Tour Mallorca Mock Web Page

A simple web site design that I built to gain more experience with working with Bootstrap and test out things I had recently learned (at the time). The project is my idea of what a basic site for a travel agency focused on the island of Mallorca in Spain would be like. All images of Mallorca were taken by me during my time spent living in Spain. Built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Prerequisites
Nothing extra needs to be done/installed from the user (Bootstrap is loaded from a CDN).
